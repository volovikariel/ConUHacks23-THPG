### Inspiration

We thought passwords were cool, and CSE's security challenge seemed like the most... well, challenging. So we decided to make a fun password generator with all the basic tools neede plus more!
What it does

It generates passwords using common words from the dictionary, and provides supporting data about the strength of generated passwords. It also gives cool images to help you remember your password.

### How we built it

We made it a chrome extension, and used a publically available diceware dictionary to generate passwords with. 
We used JS, CSS, HTML, BootStrap, jQuery and DeepAI

### Challenges we ran into

UI challenges and a lack of experience with chrome extensions made this a lot more difficult than it needed to be, but we are happy to report that we have a working project at the end of it.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

WE FINISHED IT (yay), and perserved through a severe lack of sleep among the team. We are happy that we implemented 90% of the features we originally planned for the program.

### What we learned

A lot about javascript, its interaction with chrome extensions, and the IMPORTANCE OF PASSWORD SAFETY.
